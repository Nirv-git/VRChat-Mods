## PortableMirror
This mod allows the user to locally spawn a mirror for themselves in any VRChat world.
The mirror can be configured:
  * Allow/disallow mirror pickup
  * Toggle optimized mirror
  * Configurable mirror size

__Changes in this fork__
More mirrors! Lazily added a 45 degree, ceiling, transparent and small mirror with UIX menu to control settings for (optimized and pickup able) 

* v1.2.8
	* Now can adjust the distance of the mirror live with UIX menu
	* The options for disabling and enabling the separate mirrors should update live instead of needing a restart 
* v1.3.0
	* Added a Transparent Mirror
		* When enabled the Transparent Mirror will force all mirrors to Optimized or Full, this is configurable in settings. 
		* This is using [VRCPlayersOnlyMirror](https://github.com/acertainbluecat/VRCPlayersOnlyMirror)
	* Added size controls for all mirrors (Page 2 of Mirror Settings)
	* Pickup range for MicroMirror is now Configurable, defaults to .1f
	* Mirror buttons in Settings are now toggles so you can tell what is enabled
