## PortableMirror
This mod allows the user to locally spawn a mirror for themselves in any VRChat world.
The mirror can be configured:
  * Allow/disallow mirror pickup
  * Toggle optimized mirror
  * Configurable mirror size

__Changes in this fork__
More mirrors! Lazily added a 45 degree, ceiling and small mirror with UIX menu to control settings for (optimized and pickup able) 

* v1.2.8
	* Now can adjust the distance of the mirror live with UIX menu
	* The options for disabling and enabling the separate mirrors should update live instead of needing a restart
